  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * patches/02-keep_source_when_copying.patch: keep source when
    cut/pasting a directory across filesystems, avoiding data loss when
    the copy fails. Next upstream really fixes #593607, but this
    work-around downgrades its severity from critical to normal in wheezy.
