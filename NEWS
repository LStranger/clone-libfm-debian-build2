Changes on 1.0.2 since 1.0.1:

* Added 'no_usb_trash' option into config file, defaulted to 0, which
    defines whether skip trashing files on removable media or not. If
    defined to skip then files will go into "trash-unsupported" and user
    will be asked by fm_file_ops_job_run_with_progress() to remove them
    instead.

* Added 'no_child_non_expandable' option into config file, defaulted to
    0, which adds feature to hide expanders on non-expandable rows so no
    extra 'No Sub Folder' rows are shown. No automation on that is done
    still since it may be expensive sometimes.

* Corrected underscores (mnemonics) on every menu and dialog.

* Fixed GTK+ 3.0 compatibility problems. Libfm can be compiled with Gtk
    2.18 ... 3.x and Glib 2.22+ currently (if glib < 2.26 or vala < 0.13
    still requires run configure --disable-actions). Added new switch to
    configure script --with-gtk=N where N is GTK+ generation to be used,
    may be either 2 or 3. Default is 2.

* Enabled option to Unmount removable media without ejecting it.

* Migrated menu:// support into built-in VFS. There will be support for
    menu editing functions later.

* Added search engine. Supports search:// URIs and has the UI represented
    by API fm_launch_search_simple().

* Full name in Icon View mode now shown in tooltip while long names are
    placed under icons in truncated form.

* Added ability to change columns of view. Works only for Detailed List
    View in FmStandardView widget for now. Implementation for other modes
    and widgets will come later on demand.

* Added a FmSortMode enumerator (similar to GtkSortType) with few modes
    specific fo file manager (ascending/descending is one of new modes).

* Sorting set/get functions moved from FmFolderView into FmFolderModel.
    Sorting isn't remembered by implementations of FmFolderView anymore
    so application should set sorting explicitly after creation of new
    FmFolderModel instance. Previously FmFolderView remembered it and no
    explicit setting was required.

* A lot of lesser bugfixes.


Changes on 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Fixed slowness on loading and changing of very large folders.

* FmFolderView is converted into generic interface. Former FmFolderView
    is renamed into FmStandardView so APIs specific to it have changed
    their names and arguments. Old APIs left for compatibility reasons.
    New FmFolderView interface now contains methods to handle popups,
    keyboard and mouse gestures, including Cut/Copy/Paste operations.

* Fixed compatibility with systems that are a bit old so have neither
    decent Vala compiler nor GLib 2.26.

* Few lesser bugfixes.
